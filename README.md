# automation
I developed codes using Visual Basic, this code automates manual tasks such as ETL processes used to graph data into a PPT. 
This is done by using the macros on Excel, this way the extract the data from the excel sheet and then it's loaded into the powerpoint presentation.

What you'll need: 

Powerpoint File to update (.pptx)
Excel File to extract the data (.xlsx)
Excel Button File to run the macros (.xlsx)



NOTE: Take into account you'll need to develop a button to run the script on excel. Using excel macros. Also remember to use the correct routes/paths while using the script on the excel tool.
NOTE: These are two scripts with the same function, however they're made for different types of data loads and graphs. You'll need to adapt this code in order to use it for your own personalized data structure.

By doing this we automate manual tasks that take a lot of human resources and time. This way, we spend resources into data analysis and get more efficient and precise results.

Hope you enjoy the templates and script!
