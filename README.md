# automation
I developed a code in Visual Basic, this code automates manual tasks such as ETL processes used to graph data into a PPT. 
This is done by using the macros on Excel, this way the extract the data from the excel sheet and then it's loaded into the powerpoint. 
By doing this we automate manual tasks that take a lot of human resources and time. This way we spend resources into data analysis and get more efficient and precise results.
